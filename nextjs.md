## Start Application:
```js
npm run dev
```

## Basic Folder/File Structure:
* node_modules contains all installed packages.
* public folder contains images/icons.
* .gitignore file used to specify files and folder, not push to github like node_modules, .env, etc.
* package.json: specify the dependencies/packages installed with version.
* src folder is main folder where we work and create components, etc.
* Inside src folder, app directory is present:
* In the app directory:
    - Folders are used to define routes. A route is a single path of nested folders, following the hierarchy from the root folder down to a final leaf folder that includes a page.js file.
    - Files are used to create UI that is shown for the route segment.
    - To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other. For example, you can add a new /dashboard/settings route by nesting two new folders in the app directory.
    - The /dashboard/settings route is composed of three segments: <br>
        / (Root segment)  <br>
        dashboard (Segment)   <br>
        settings (Leaf segment)   <br>
* File convention:
    - page.js: Create the unique UI of a route and make the path publicly accessible.
    - route.js: Create server-side API endpoints for a route.
    - layout.js: Create shared UI for a segment and its children. A layout wraps a page or child segment.
    - loading.js: Create loading UI for a segment and its children. loading.js wraps a page or child segment in a React Suspense Boundary, showing the loading UI while they load.
    - not-found.js: Create UI to show when the notFound function is thrown within a route segment or when a URL is not matched by any route.

### layout.js:
* We can create components and add in this file like header, footer, etc just like app.js in react.
* e.g.->
```js
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {/* header */}
        <Header/>
        {/* navbar */}
        
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

<br>

### page.js:
- this is the default home page.

### File based routing:
- In react we have to use react-router-dom to create routes like about, home, etc.
- But in nextjs, we have to create folder inside app directory with route name like about, home, etc and within this folder create a file name page.js for every route folder.

### Components Folder:
* Create a folder in app directory named components.
* Now in components folder create components like Header.jsx,... just like react.
* Within Header create page as we do in react.
* After creating component import it to layout.js same as react as we do in app.js.

### Styles Folder:
* Create a styles folder in app directory same as react and create css file inside it with name header.module.css to specify style to that component only.
* Import css file same as react and use styling using className={styles.task1}.

### link/image component:
- Link is a React component that extends the HTML element to provide prefetching and client-side navigation between routes. It is the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js.
```js
  import Link from 'next/link';

  export default function Page() {
    return <Link href="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>;
  }
```
- see Navbar.js component to understand better.

### Main working files:
1. Header.js is a header component of this project.
2. Navbar.js is a navbar component of this project.
3. Tasks folder container the component of all 5 tasks.
4. Within the tasks folder page.js file is present where we create component.
5. Task component shows the data of task using table and getting data from server using fetch under useEffect.
6. For all task component uses api call to get data and display.
